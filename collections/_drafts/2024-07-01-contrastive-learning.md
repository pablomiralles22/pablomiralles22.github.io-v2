Earlier this year I had to write a technical report on the topic of contrastive
learning
([link](/assets/pdf/projects/contrastive-learning-report/report.pdf)).
This post is an effort to create something more digestible and adequate for
reading. The goal is to give an introduction to representation learning, as well
as taking a look at the techniques labelled as "contrastive" to learn those
representations.

## Representations, transfer learning and self-supervised learning

Consider some neural network such as the following:

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/posts/2024_contrastive-learning/nn_repr.pdf" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

Neural networks are the composition of transformations, where each intermediate
layer outputs a function of the input coming from the previous one. The output
of each intermediate layer is a new view or **representation** of the input
data. These representations are nothing but vector, holding features or
characteristics of the input. Of course, neural networks are not interpretable,
and these vectors of values do not necessarily hold any meaning for us.
The network learns to progressively transform the data into a set of features
that is useful to perform the task we are training it for. For example, if we
are training for image classification of animals, the network might learn a
representation with the number of legs, the shape of the eyes, the color...

At the end of the network, we have a layer that transforms the last
representation into the prediction, such as a regression value or a probability
distribution over the different classes in our classification problem.

When we train this network on our dataset, we are not only teaching it how to
make predictions, we are teaching it to extract intermediate representations
with features that are useful for the task. This is interesting because these
representations might be useful for other tasks as well. For example, imagine we
want to add a new class of animals in our classification example. Perhaps the
network is already capable of getting features to predict that class. We can
then modify the final head and freeze the rest of the weights of the network.
With fewer parameters to learn, we can train with less data, much faster and
with a smaller energy consumption.

In fact, if the learned representations are rich enough, we might be able to
use the same network for a myriad of different tasks, training only a small
head at the end of the network. This is called **transfer learning**: first
**pretraining** for a **pretext task**, and then **fine-tuning** the model
(perhaps modifying the head) on the **downstream task** we are actually
interested in solving. The following diagram shows this process.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/posts/2024_contrastive-learning/transfer-learning.drawio.pdf" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Learning very general representations: self-supervised learning

Another important and related concept is that of **self-supervised
learning**. This term, although poorly coined in my opinion, can be useful to
refer to a particular set of tasks. The term refers to supervised tasks where
we can generate a training signal automatically, without the need for human
labeling. One example is the training procedure of the language model
BERT<d-cite key="devlin2019BERTPretraining"/>, called Masked Language Modeling
(MLM). In this task, some parts of the input text are masked, and the model has
to recover them based on the unmasked context. We can then use any
available text on the internet and generate training examples by masking parts
of it. This allows us to generate massive datasets, and thus train very large
neural networks with a nuanced understanding of the distribution of human text.
These large networks learn very general representations, that we can then
transfer to a great number of tasks. In fact, BERT achieved state-of-the-art
performance in several downstream tasks.

Let's consider another example, this time with images. Images allow us very
simple forms of data augmentation: we can crop, rotate, translate, convert to
greyscale, modify the brightness... We can train a neural network to produce
similar representations for augmented views of the same image, and different
representations for views of different images. Again, we can generate examples
with any image we find, allowing us to create very large datasets and train
massive networks that obtain general representations. As we will see, this is
in fact our first example of contrastive learning.

### Advantages and disadvantages

Representation learning (and transfer learning) has supposed a revolution in
the field, for the reasons we discuss now:

1. **It can greatly improve performance for some tasks**. Let's consider the
   example of sentiment analysis in text. Textual data is very diverse and
   nuanced. Even the same word can represent different sentiments depending on
   the context. A small dataset of examples labeled by humans is unlikely to
   produce a model with detailed understanding of text. By pretraining a large
   model on a difficult task with a gigantic set of examples, we get a model
   with nuanced understanding of text, and this is likely to produce better
   results on our downstream task as well.

2. Another way to put the previous point is that **it alleviates data
   bottlenecks**. If we don't have enough data to train a decent model for a
   task, we can try to pretrain on some pretext task and then fine-tune small
   parts of the model with the supervised data we have.

3. **It improves generalization**. Let's consider the sentiment analysis task
   again. The pretrained model might learn some features regarding sentiment,
   and it was trained on a large dataset of text. This means that most words
   have a representation in a common feature space. Even if some words do not
   appear on our labeled examples, the pretrained model should be able to
   extrapolate what it learns from the labeled data.

4. **It allows us to use large and powerful model at a fraction of the cost**.
   We find many open source models nowadays, and using them for inference
   requires much fewer resources than for training.

5. **Some model have zero-shot capabilities**. This means that we can perform
   inference on tasks it wasn't trained for without any need for fine-tuning.
   We have all seen ChatGPT performing a myriad of different tasks, even though
   it was only trained to do next-token prediction.

   Another example is CLIP<d-cite key="radford2021LearningTransferable"/>. This
   model was trained using contrastive techniques. It encodes text and images
   into a common feature vector space. If a text describes an image properly,
   then their representation should be close together in the space. This allows
   us to perform arbitrary image classification as long as we have textual
   labels for the classes. We simply pick the class with the textual label that
   is closest to the image embedding.

Of course, not everything is bright. Training big and general models is very
expensive, and only big companies with large resources can afford to do so. We
may also find that these models are overkill for some tasks. A smaller and more
specialized model can sometimes perform better, specially if the learned
representations aren't very good for the particular task. Finally, although
zero-shot capabilities are very interesting, performance tends to be subpar.


## Contrastive learning

Roughly speaking, in contrastive learning we try to learn vector representation
of the input data by comparing and contrasting examples with each other. For
instances that we deem similar in some sense, we want their vector
representation to be close according to some distance or metric function. On
the other hand, the vector representation of dissimilar examples should be
further apart. Images provide an easy example. We would expect pictures of
animals to be close together, and far apart from pictures of buildings. Inside
the cluster of pictures of animals, we would also like for pictures of the same
animal to be closer than pictures of different animals, and so on.

### Basic concepts and notation

Let’s establish a framework and notation for the rest of the text.

- We first consider a set of networks, called *encoders*, that map the input
  data to a fixed sized vector representation of dimension $d$. We may have
  one or multiple encoders, depending on the problem. For example, if we are
  trying to map both text and images to a common representation space, we
  need a different encoder for each domain.

  Mathematically, the $k$-th encoder $e_k$ maps the examples in some input
  space $\mathcal{X}_k$ onto a $d$-dimensional vector space:

  $$
    \begin{align*}
	e_k(\cdot;\theta_k): \mathcal{X}_k &\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^d \\\\
	x &\longmapsto e_k(x; \theta_k )
    .\end{align*}
  $$

  Here, $\theta_k$ are the parameters of the neural network that we would like
  to optimize. In cases where a single encoder is used, we will omit the $k$
  subscript.

- Additionally, we can assume without loss of generality that a final
    head $h_k(\cdot, \eta_k)$ maps these representations to an $m$-dimensional
    metric space, where the notion of distance or similarity is actually
    applied between the vectors. The point of adding this final transformation
    is to separate two tasks: finding a general representation that can be applied
    to other problems and finding a representation in a metric space where the
    notion of distance represents some real-world semantic similarity. The former
    is typically better for transfer learning. If we didn't need this separation,
    we may assume that this is the identity function.

- The metric is given by a distance or similarity function $\mathbb{R}^m
    \times \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}$, such as the Euclidean distance
    $\|\|z_1 - z_2\|\|$ or the cosine similarity $\frac{\langle z_1, z_2
    \rangle}{\|\|z_1\|\| \|\|z_2\|\|}$. Similarity functions take larger values
    for similar examples, and will be denoted by $s$, whereas distance
    functions, denoted by $d$, are lower bounded by zero and take smaller
    values for similar instances.

- A loss function $\mathcal{L}$ is built using this similarity notion
    for a set of encoded examples, penalizing large distances for similar
    instances, and small distances for dissimilar examples. We will take
    a closer look into loss functions in the next sections.

- Finally, given an example $x \in \mathcal{X}$, we will denote by
    $v=e(x)$ its vector representation in the general feature space, and by
    $z=h(v)$ its embedding in the metric space. Instances that we consider
    similar to an anchor example $x$ will be called positive examples and be
    denoted by a plus superscript $x^+$. We define negative examples
    analogously and denote them by a minus superscript $x^-$. The same
    superscript notation will be applied to vectors $v$ and $z$.

This structure is shown graphically in the following diagram:

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/posts/2024_contrastive-learning/contrastive-learning.drawio.pdf" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Loss functions in contrastive learning

Loss functions are generated from the distance/similarity metric applied to
different pairs of examples. It should penalize similar examples being far away
and dissimilar examples being close. The latter is as important as the former,
otherwise the network could learn the trivial representation of mapping any
example to the same vector.

#### Pair loss

Let $x \in \mathcal{X}$ be an example and $z = h(e(x))$ its embedding in the
metric space. The *pair loss*<d-cite key="chopra2005LearningSimilarity"/> is
defined for pairs of examples, differing for positive and negative ones: 

$$
  \begin{cases}
    \mathcal{L}(x, x^+) &= D(z, z^+)^2 \\
    \mathcal{L}(x, x^-) &= \max (0, \varepsilon - D(z, z^-)^2),
  \end{cases}
$$

where $D$ is some distance function such as the Euclidean distance. By
minimizing this expression, the distance to positive samples should be close to
zero, and dissimilar instances should be separated by a margin of at least
$\varepsilon$. The function is plotted in the following figure.

    examples. Arrows represent gradient direction and norm.

        </div>
    </div>
</div>



#### Triplet loss

The *triplet loss*<d-cite key="schroff2015FaceNetunified"/> tries instead to
enforce that the distance between the anchor and positive examples is smaller
than the distance between the anchor and negative examples, with a difference
margin of at least $\varepsilon$:

$$
\label{eq:triplet-loss}
\mathcal{L}(x, x^+, x^-) = \max(0, D(z,z^+)^2 - D(z,z^-)^2 + \varepsilon)
.$$

In this last loss function, a full training example requires now both a similar
and a dissimilar instance. However, the number of interactions between
different examples is still very limited. The use of many negative examples,
specially those that are hard for the model, are crucial for a good and
efficient learning process. This makes sense intuitively: there are many more
ways in which images can be different than similar.

#### Lifted Embedding Loss

Increasing the number of interactions between instances at once, Song et al.
proposed the *Lifted Embedding loss*<d-cite key="song2016DeepMetric"/>. If
$x_1, \cdots, x_n$ is our set of examples, and $P$ and $N$ are the sets of pairs
of examples that are considered similar and dissimilar, respectively, then the
loss function is given as

$$\label{eq:lifted-structure-loss}
  \mathcal{L} (N, P) = \frac{1}{2 |P|} \sum_{(i,j) \in P} \max (0, L_{i,j})^2
,$$

where

$$L_{i,j} = D_{i,j} + \log \left( 
    \sum_{(i,k) \in N} e^{\varepsilon - D_{i,k}} +
    \sum_{(j,l) \in N} e^{\varepsilon - D_{j,l}}
   \right)
,$$

and $D_{i,j} = D(z_i, z_j)$. The expression for $L_{i,j}$ is
actually used because it is a smooth upper bound for

$$\hat{L}_{i,j} = D_{i,j} + \max \left( 
    \max_{(i,k) \in N} \varepsilon - D_{i,k},
    \max_{(j,l) \in N} \varepsilon - D_{j,l}
   \right)
,$$

so this loss can be interpreted as an adaptation to the triplet
loss, trying to mine the hardest negative example of the set for each
positive pair, and squaring after the difference of distances. As usual
in deep learning, instead of using the full set of examples, the loss is
approximated with a batch of smaller size.

#### Binary Noise-Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss

Let’s now take a probabilistic perspective. Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be two
random variables that take values in our domain of examples $\mathcal{X}$
(e.g. images). Let $Y$ be another random variable that takes the value of
$1$ if $X_1$ and $X_2$ are similar according to our concept of similarity,
and $0$ otherwise. It follows a Bernoulli distribution, and we can try to
approximate its conditional probability mass function with our network as

$$
\hat{p} (1 | x_1, x_2) = \sigma ( s(z_1, z_2) )
,$$

where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function. If $q^+(\cdot, \cdot)$ and $q^-(\cdot,
\cdot)$ are the joint probability density functions of similar and dissimilar
instances, respectively, then the Binary Noise-Contrastive Estimation
(NCE)<d-cite key="gutmann2010Noisecontrastiveestimation"/> loss is given by
minimizing the expected negative log-likelihood:

$$\begin{gathered}
  \label{eq:bin-nce}
  \mathcal{L}_{Bin-NCE} =
  -\mathbb{E}_{q^+} \log \hat{p} (1| x_1, x_2) \\
  -\mathbb{E}_{q^-} \log (1-\hat{p} (1| x_1, x_2))
,
\end{gathered}$$

where the expected value would be approximated by its population mean (e.g.
with a single batch). Keeping the previous notation for the sets of positive
pairs $P$ and negative pairs $N$, this yields:

$$\begin{gathered}
  \label{eq:bin-nce-2}
  \mathcal{L}_{Bin-NCE} =
  -\frac{1}{|P|} \sum_{(i,j) \in P} \log \sigma(s(z_i, z_j))  \\
  -\frac{1}{|N|} \sum_{(i,j) \in N} \log (1-\sigma(s(z_i, z_j)))
.
\end{gathered}$$

#### InfoNCE

A more recent loss function is InfoNCE <d-cite
key="oord2019RepresentationLearning"/>. In their setting, instead of
considering a binary classification problem they assume a ranking one. Having
fixed an anchor instance $x$, let $x_0^+,x_1^-, \cdots,x_n^-$ be a set of
possible similar instances, where only $x_0^+$ is a positive example. The
problem becomes one of ranking which example is more likely to be positive. The
probability of each of the samples can be approximated by a softmax operation
on a similarity score with respect to $x$:

$$
\label{eq:info-nce-p}
\hat{p} (i|x, S) = \frac{\exp(s(x, x_i))}{\sum_{j = 0}^{n} \exp(s(x, x_j))}
.$$

Minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the true positive yields:

$$
\label{eq:info-nce}
\mathcal{L}_{InfoNCE} = 
  - \mathbb{E} \log \frac{\exp(s(x, x_0^+))}{\sum_{j = 0}^{n} \exp(s(x, x_j))}
.$$

As we will see, it is a common setting to have batches of pairs of similar
instances $(x_1,x_1^\prime),\cdots,(x_n,x_n^\prime)$, where instances across
pairs are considered to be dissimilar. We can compute a similarity matrix $S =
(s(z_i, z_j^\prime))_{i,j}$, where the main diagonal values should be high and
the rest should be low. In this case, one can calculate the InfoNCE across rows
or columns. It is also possible to average both options, yielding a *symmetric
InfoNCE* loss.

#### NT-Xent

A temperature parameter $\tau$ can be included in the sotfmax operation (see
e.g. ), transforming the softmax probability distribution into

$$
P(i|x, S) = \frac{\exp(s(x, x_i) / \tau)}{\sum_{j = 0}^{n} \exp(s(x, x_j) / \tau)}
.$$

A small value of $\tau$ makes the softmax sharper, and small differences
between the similarity of positive and negative examples already produces a
high likelihood. A large value of $\tau$ forces the difference in similarity to
be large. This parameter can be viewed as the margin parameter in previous
functions. This modified InfoNCE loss is called *NT-Xent* (normalized
temperature-scaled cross entropy loss)<d-cite key="chen2020SimpleFramework"/>.

### Generating data for contrastive learning

We have already seen how to create a loss function to train our model, but how
do we get appropriate data? In most cases, the question is how to generate
pairs of similar examples, as sometimes you can get away with assuming that
examples in different pairs are dissimilar. This is the case when you have a
huge domain, such as a large amount of internet images. Getting two similar
examples in the same batch by sampling randomly is unlikely. Still, we could
incur in false negatives, something we will discuss in the next section. This
setting is called *instance-level discrimination*<d-cite
key="wu2018UnsupervisedFeature"/>, as we assume that each instance forms its
own class. We will now list some of the ways in which we can generate datasets
for contrastive learning.

#### Human supervision

Of course, human annotation is always an option, albeit a very expensive one.
Unfortunately, this is sometimes necessary. We previously talked about CLIP, a
model that learned representations for text and image, mapping texts that
correctly describe an image to an embedding close to the embedding of the
image. In this case, there is no way around getting someone to create captions
for different images (although there could be some future in synthetic data
generation with multimodal models).

One way to reduce the amount of data necessary when human labeling is required
is to first pretrain the encoders with some other self-supervised technique.
For example, in CLIP, you could train the text and image encoders separately
with a denoising task, and then use the supervised data to align the
representations of both encoders to a common metric space.

#### Self-supervision

What if we want to generate large amounts of data from existing sources
automatically? We now list some techniques to do this. We assume in all of the
*instance-level discrimination* setting described earlier, so we only need to
generate positive examples. The following are just some examples:

* **Data augmentation**. In the particular context of contrastive learning, a
    transformation that does not change the instance semantically can be applied to
    generate positive examples. To illustrate this, assume that we are
    contrasting images, and we want to map images based on the concepts inside
    them. Then if we crop, blur, or saturate the color of an image of a cat, it
    is still an image of a cat. This way, augmentations of similar or equal
    instances are also similar, whereas augmentations of dissimilar examples
    are also dissimilar.

    In the case of images, we find transformations such as rotations,
    translations, cutouts, cropping and resizing, blurring, applying noise...
    These were used, for example, in <d-cite key="chen2020SimpleFramework"/>.

    Textual data is a bit more complex. Fang et al.<d-cite
    key="fang2020CERTContrastive"/> use automatic back-translation, that is,
    translation to a different language and then back to the source language,
    to generate pairs of different but semantically equivalent segments of
    text. Many other techniques can be used: changing characters, masking
    words, adding noise, changing words for synonyms...

    Careful exploration of data augmentation techniques can be very important.
    For example, Chen et al. <d-cite key="chen2020SimpleFramework"/> found that
    the training of SimCLR was very sensitive to the choice of data
    augmentation techniques.

* **Multi-sensor**. When multiple inputs are capture simultaneously, we can
    use all inputs from corresponding times. For example, capturing the same
    image from different angles with multiple cameras, or the combination of
    audio and image in videos.

* **Continuity**. This can be applied to domains where there
    are sequences with some continuity. For example, videos are sequences of
    images where most contiguous frames are almost equal. We can take images
    very close in time and assume they are very likely to be similar.


### Discussion on negative examples

We have seen in that most loss functions use both positive and negatives
examples. There is a simple theoretical reason for this: if negative examples
were not used, a trivial representation mapping everything to one vector would
obtain perfect performance.

There is empirical evidence showing that performance is increased from
contrasting with many negative examples. For example, Chen et al. <d-cite
key="chen2020SimpleFramework"/>found that training with very large batch sizes
greatly improved performance. In their setting, all other examples in the batch
were considered as negative, and thus the number of negatives per example
scaled with the batch size.

There are several topics discussed around the usage and generation of
negative examples in contrastive learning, and this section provides an
overview of some of them.

#### False negatives in self-supervised contrastive learning

In data generation section, we already talked at the possibility of false
negatives when there is no supervision. This is because we are drawing from the
full distribution of examples instead of the distribution of negative examples,
creating a bias. Some work has been done on correcting this while not requiring
manual labels for negatives. While we won't get into detail, the reader may
find an example in the *Debiased Contrastive loss* proposed in <d-cite
key="chuang2020DebiasedContrastive"/>.

#### Alleviating hardware bottlenecks for large amounts of negative samples

We have seen the use of examples in the same batch as negatives. This presents
a major drawback in terms of computing resources. If we want to use many
negative examples, we are forced to select a very large batch size, requiring a
lot of GPU memory. Some work has been done on decoupling batch size and the
number of negatives by sampling negatives from an *offline memory bank*. In
this setting, an encoded representation is kept on-disk for some or all
examples, and the loss function is not back-propagated through them. As the
encoder is updated in the training process, the representations on-disk get
outdated. The main difference between approaches lies in the method to keep
these offline representations updated as the encoder is optimized.

Wu et al. <d-cite key="wu2018UnsupervisedFeature"/> sampled negative
representations randomly from a memory bank with the full dataset. At the end
of each epoch, all the representations in the memory bank are updated with the
new checkpoint of the model.

He et al. <d-cite key="he2020MomentumContrast"/> proposed keeping a queue with
a fixed number of mini-batches. After processing a mini-batch, the new examples
are added to the queue, and the oldest mini-batch is removed. The queue is used
to sample negative examples for the current mini-batch. Since this alone
resulted in poor empirical performance, they separated the online encoder that
is being trained from an offline encoder that produces the representations for
the queue. The parameters of the offline encoder are updated through a momentum
update rule with the parameters of the online one:

$$\label{eq:moco} 
  \theta_{off} \leftarrow 
    \alpha \theta_{off} + (1-\alpha) \theta_{on},
  \qquad \alpha \in [0,1)
.$$

This smoother update yielded better empirical performance.

#### Hard negative mining

While increasing the number of negative examples has been observed to
improve performance, this might be due to the increased probability of
finding meaningful negatives to learn from.

Conceptually, we might intuit that it is more difficult for a model to
distinguish between a dog and a cat than between a dog and a building. In
practice, we might select hard negative examples based on their representation.
Examples with close representations are difficult to distinguish for the model.
Kalantidis et al.<d-cite key="kalantidis2020HardNegative"/> make use of this,
together with some data mixing techniques.

However, hard negative mining has some disadvantages, such as the
increased time complexity from sampling close neighbours and the
increased probability of drawing false negatives in the self-supervised
setting as the encoder gets better.

#### Are negative examples really necessary?

If the only reason to use negative examples is to prevent the
representations from collapsing onto one single vector, then other
techniques to prevent it could allow us to remove negative examples.

The work by Grill et al. <d-cite key="grill2020BootstrapYour"/> goes in this
line. They used two neural networks, an online (predictive) network and a
target network, similar to the idea in Deep Q Learning. They use only positive
examples, and for those the online network tries to predict the metric
representation from the target network. The parameters of the target network
are updated after every iteration with an exponential moving average of the
online parameters:

$$
\theta_{target}  \gets \alpha \theta_{target}  + (1 - \alpha) \theta_{online} 
.$$

It is not obvious to me that this approach would not converge to a collapsed
representation. The authors argue that the update to the target parameters is
not exactly according to the gradient of the loss with respect to
$\theta_{target}$. They did get good performance in downstream image
classification tasks. There is some discussion on informal mediums (see 
[this blog post](https://imbue.com/research/2020-08-24-understanding-self-supervised-contrastive-learning/)
and preprint <d-cite key="richemond2020BYOLworks"/>) on whether batch
normalization is the cause of preventing representational collapse, but I
haven’t found peer-reviewed work on the topic.

SimSiam<d-cite key="chen2021ExploringSimple"/> is an even simpler technique
that successfully avoided representational collapse. I deviate from their
notation in the explanation to keep the one in this post. If $\hat{e}=e \circ
h$ is the complete encoder onto the metric space, and $\hat{h}$ is an additional
head the call the predictor, then their loss functions for similar instances
$x_1$ and $x_2$ is given by the formula:

$$
z_1 = \hat{e} (x_1),\quad z_2 = \hat{e} (x_2)
$$

$$
p_1 = \hat{h} (z_1),\quad p_2 = \hat{h} (z_2)
$$

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{D(p_1, SG(z_2))}{2} + \frac{D(p_2, SG(z_1))}{2}
,$$

where $SG$ is the stop-gradient function, preventing backpropagation through
that branch, and $D$ is the negative cosine similarity. Again, how this
asymmetry through the additional head and stopping gradient propagation is not
fully understood to the best of my knowledge.

Bardes et al. <d-cite key="bardes2022vicreg"/> proposed a much more intuitive
approach, using VICReg (Variance-Invariance-Covariance regularization). Let
$(z_1, z_1^\prime), \dots, (z_n, z_n^\prime)$ be metric representations of
positive pairs in a single batch, where each $z_i, z_i^\prime$ is a vector of
dimension $d$. Let $C(Z)$ be the covariance matrix **of the features** for the
matrix $Z=(z_1, \dots, z_n) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$:

$$
C(Z) = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (z_i - \overline{z})(z_i - \overline{z})^T
,$$

where $\hat{z} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} z_i$ is the empirical mean. Then the
loss function has the following three terms:

* **Invariance**. Forces the positive examples to be close together:

    $$
    \mathcal{I} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \| z_i - z_i^\prime \|^2
    .$$
* **Variance**. Forces the variance of each feature to be positive, above some
    threshold value:

    $$
    \begin{gathered}
    \mathcal{V} =
    \frac{1}{d} \sum_{j=1}^{d}  \max \left(0, \sqrt{C(Z)_{j,j} + \epsilon} \right) + \\
    \frac{1}{d} \sum_{j=1}^{d}  \max \left(0, \sqrt{C(Z^\prime)_{j,j} + \epsilon} \right)
    .\end{gathered}
    $$

* **Covariance**. Forces the features to be uncorrelated:

    $$
    \mathcal{C} =
    \frac{1}{d} \sum_{i,j=1; i\neq j}^{d}  C(Z)_{i,j}^2 +
    \frac{1}{d} \sum_{i,j=1; i\neq j}^{d}  C(Z^\prime)_{i,j}^2
    .$$

The final loss is a weighted sum of the previous terms:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{I}  + \lambda \mathcal{V}  + \mu \mathcal{C} 
,$$

where $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are positive hyperparameters. The workings of this
approach are much more intuitive and clear: the regularization terms explicitly
prevent the representation from collapsing, as collapsed representations have
zero feature variance. Decorrelating the features might be useful for
interpretability purposes.


### Applications

We have already discussed the benefits of representation learning in general.
But does contrastive learning have any particular advantages? This is what we
discuss here.

The first advantage is that it provides other training ideas for representation
learning. These techniques have shown great success in producing state-of-the-art
performance in semi-supervised and transfer learning. This is the example of
the SimCLR model for images<d-cite key="chen2020SimpleFramework"/>, for example.

A second advantage is the metric representation that they learn. These
representations can layer be used in very efficient<d-footnote>There are
techniques to approximately find the closest vectors to the input in a vector
database, such as Locality-Sensitive Hashing or k-d Trees.</d-footnote> vector
searches, allowing us to search for examples in our database that are similar
**semantically** to the input example. Thinking of search engines for examples,
we can now find texts that talk about something similar to our search prompt,
without the need to use any common word. With multilingual models, we might
even search in many different languages at the same time. Many language models
have been trained to do this, such as the old Sentence-BERT<d-cite key="reimers2019SentenceBERTSentencea"/>.

Although not exclusive to contrastive learning techniques, these techniques
allow us to align different encoders in a common representation space, in
particular encoders of different modalities. This is the case of the
CLIP<d-cite key="radford2021LearningTransferable"/> model we have already
talked about.

Finally, models trained through contrastive learning have zero-shot
classification capabilities. If you have some anchor examples that represent a
category, you can classify a new example by selecting the category with the
closest metric representation. In the case of CLIP, since it has a text
encoder, you can provide any textual label that describes the category, and
apply this inference technique. If there are no textual encoders, you could
still use a small portion of labeled data to create a metric representation of
each class. Of course, performance is not as good as with fully-trained models,
specially for very niche categories, but it might still be useful with very few
resources.


## Conclusions

That it is for this post. I would say the main takeaways are the following:
* Contrastive learning provides another way to learn representations.
* These models allow for great applications such as semantic vector search
    or zero-shot classification.
* Training one of these models from scratch might requires a particularly
    large amount of resources, given that it needs a large batch size. The
    techniques to avoid the need for negative examples might also suffer a bit
    from smaller batches, at least the VICReg approach, from what I have read.
* Different loss functions and ways to generate data for contrastive learning.

I hope the post was useful to you and perhaps not too boring to read!
